            <p style="float: left;" class="main"> I am originally from Chicago, but I currently live in Vorarlberg, the western part of Austria.
                My professional background is in banking and financial analysis. However, I have made 
                a rather drastic change in career. I have recently secured a new role as a software engineer and
                I am currently taking a software development course. Wish me luck!
